        <h2 id="whatis">What is monkeypox?</h2>
        <p>Monkeypox is a zoonotic viral disease, endemic in western and central Africa,
which circulates in wild animal hosts and emerges periodically to affect humans,
captive or wild nonhuman primates, and other species, particularly rodents. Congo
Basin monkeypox viruses are particularly virulent, with human case fatality rates in
parts of Africa estimated to be around 10%. West African viruses tend to cause milder
disease; however, deaths are seen occasionally in young children, individuals with
secondary bacterial sepsis or rare complications such as encephalitis, and people who
are immunosuppressed.</p>
        <h2 id="transmission">Transmission</h2>
        <p>Monkeypox viruses has been found in skin lesions and
most or all secretions and excretions (e.g., urine, feces, and
oral, nasal and conjunctival exudates) in animals. Likely
routes of transmission include inhalation, direct inoculation
into breaks in the skin, and the ingestion of infected tissues.
The importance of aerosol transmission might differ
between species or situations. Experimentally infected
prairie dogs can shed monkeypox viruses until 21 days after
inoculation, and limited evidence suggests that some small
animals, such as dormice and Gambian giant pouched rats,
might carry this virus for a few weeks or months. Viral
DNA was detected in the tissues, urine and feces of one
dormouse for at least 6 months, but no viral antigens were
found when this animal was euthanized. Whether such
animals can shed infectious virus is not known.
Humans can become infected via bites from animals,
in aerosols during close contact, or by direct contact with
lesions, blood or body fluids. Sexual transmission was
suspected in a few cases, when there were lesions on the
genitalia, and transplacental transmission has been
documented. In Africa, clinical cases have often been
linked to handling, preparing and eating wild animals, but
person-to-person transmission was also significant in
some outbreaks. In the U.S., most cases occurred among
people who had close direct contact with prairie dogs;
some infections were apparently acquired in scratches and
bites, or through open wounds. Monkeypox virus has been
isolated from humans for up to 18 days after the onset of
the rash, and scabs shed during recovery were found to
contain significant amounts of infectious virus. Person-toperson transmission does not seem to be capable of
maintaining the virus in human populations. </p>
