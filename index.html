        <h2 id="whatis">What is monkeypox?</h2>
        <p>Monkeypox is a zoonotic viral disease, endemic in western and central Africa,
which circulates in wild animal hosts and emerges periodically to affect humans,
captive or wild nonhuman primates, and other species, particularly rodents. Congo
Basin monkeypox viruses are particularly virulent, with human case fatality rates in
parts of Africa estimated to be around 10%. West African viruses tend to cause milder
disease; however, deaths are seen occasionally in young children, individuals with
secondary bacterial sepsis or rare complications such as encephalitis, and people who
are immunosuppressed.</p>
